	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> The biggest challenge that I had while working on this lab was getting the script output to work. I was getting frustrated becuase I was able to get the output to work for last lab so why couldn't I get it to work this time! After much indenting, pressing spacebar, and rewriting things I just couldn't get it right. I then began to compare my js file for Lab 6 and Lab 5 to see if I could catch anything that was different between the two. After 20 minutes of switching through tabs I realized I forgot to finish my comment block with a * /. </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> After much struggle with figuring out the issue of the script output, I was so excited once I saw that I was able to see all my hard work appear on my personal website. Now I am able to make Lab 6 fit the aesthetic of the rest of my pages.
