    <h1> Angela Rangel </h1>
    <p> My name is Angela Rangel, I am a third year who is majoring in Theatre Arts and I'm thinking about majoring in Education as well. The reason I am taking this class is because I need the Math General Education credit lol. Despite that, I have been enjoying making my own websites, I find it lots of fun. In my free time I like to read, sing, and play videdo games. I am also bored of always adding an image of myself so instead I will add an image of favorite show!</p>

      <p>Bee is a cheerful, eccentric young woman in her early twenties who is habitually fired from menial, low-paying jobs. On her way home from a failed job opportunity, PuppyCat, a strange, mysterious creature, falls from the sky. She takes him in and, when he sees that she is broke and unemployed, PuppyCat teleports himself and Bee to an alternate dimension where they are given a job by TempBot, a gigantic, intelligent television screen. Despite the dangers that this line of temporary jobs would pose, Bee finds that she has a talent for the work and that it pays well enough for her to disregard the dangers.</p>
