    <h1>Lab 14: Debugging and Strategies</h1>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge that I had was setting up Lab 9. When I finished it I realized I didn't finish my css for the lab so I just made it pretty.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Biggest problem I had was figuring out how I wanted the stuff to look. Everything is working as it should.</p>

    <h2>Results/Debugging</h2>
