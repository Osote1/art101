			<p> Alli spoke to me when I arrived to section late. I was stressed about missing out on important information, but turns out the TA never showed up. So I woke up for no reason, that is what I would say if Alli wasn't there :)\
			Alli says I can't measure because I called her short but I am shorter than her!!! :O </p>

			<p> Angela is my partner. We met on the first day of section, when our TA never showed up. It was funny because Angela already had a partner, but then he came up and told us he was dropping :) yay for me! I was hoping that they wouldn't last so I could steal her, muahahaha.</p>
