		<h1> Lab 8: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving </h2>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div id=challenge>
				<p> The biggeset challenge that I had was trying to figure wich function I wanted to configure. I attempted to due a multiplication function, but that didn't work out. I attempted to perform the bonus task, but I was confused on the coding of "var outputEl = document.getElementById("output"); outputEl.innerHTML = mapResults; // put your results here"</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Problems</h3>
				<p> As I mentioned before, I attempted to create a multiplication function of my own. It worked at first, but things got all jumbo bumbled.</p>

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>Once I did a different function that I knew and was comfortable with, everything went pretty smoothly.</p>

<div id="output">
