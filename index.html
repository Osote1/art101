		<p>The reason I am taking ART 101 is because I needed a class to fufill my math General Education credit. Since I didn't want to take the math placement test, I decided "why not take a class that doesn't require me to do that!" I found myself to be a genius for being such an amazing problem solver. Little did I know, coding is also difficult. Just becuase it is artistic it doesn't mean that it'll easy! You should know better Angela! You're a Theatre Arts major!!! Anyways, now we have been assigned to create a website! Is it difficult? Yes. But not as difficult as the labs that we are doing. Currently as I write this (October 10th, 2022) my parthner and I are struggling on Lab 3. Hopefully we finish this later on in the evening. If we don't, I can't say we didn't warn you. Peace out! </p>
